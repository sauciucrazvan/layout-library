# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Layout Library. This repository contains a collection of reusable layout components for React. The following components are available, and each one has its own documentation with examples and usage instructions.

## Available Components

- [**Column**](./Column.md)  
  A flexible column container with support for gap, justify-content, align-items, and wrapping.

- [**Row**](./Row.md)  
  A flexible row container, similar to the Column component but with horizontal layout options.

- [**Grid**](./Grid.md)  
  A grid layout component that allows you to define the number of columns and gaps.

- [**Container**](./Container.md)  
  A container that centers content and allows you to control padding and max-width.

- [**Separator**](./Separator.md)  
  A simple horizontal separator with customizable height and color.

## Example Application

There is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application included as an example. You can find it in the main repository folder. This application demonstrates how to use all the components and integrate them into a React-based project.

To run the example application:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `example` folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd example
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can explore the example app, which showcases how each component works in a real project.
